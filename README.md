# Face Recognition OPENCV

In this project we uses the `OPENCV` module as `cv2` to detect the face of a person in a video, picture or live webcam. We put the rectangle on the faces of the person to detect.

We use the `CascadeClassifier` to get the prewrote code to detect the face.

In this project we are able to extract the specific object from the image also through help of OPENCV.

## To Detect the face
run a following command in command prompt
```
python faces.py
```
## Deployment
```
1. import the cv2
2. load haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
3. load the video(or picture or start the webcam)
4. read the video as the frames in that video
5. detect the faces through CascadeClassifier and cv2
6. and put the rectangle on their faces.
7. then show on their faces.
```
